On March 31, 2023, Twitter [open-sourced their algorithm](https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/open-source/2023/twitter-recommendation-algorithm).

It was a big day for Twitter, and for open-source. The Twitter algorithm is one of the most important parts of the Twitter experience - it determines what you see on your "For You" page, your notifications, and your search results.

Aptly named "The Algorithm", Twitter's algorithm can be found on 2 different GitHub repositories:

- [the-algorithm](https://github.com/twitter/the-algorithm)
- [the-algorithm-ml](https://github.com/twitter/the-algorithm-ml)

Here are some of my takeaways about how the Twitter algorithm works after diving into those codebases.

## 1. Your following-to-follower ratio matters.

Twitter's `Tweepcred` PageRank algorithm reduces the page rank of users who have a low number of followers but a high number of followings.

> This method reduces the page rank of users who have a low number of followers but a high number of followings. It calculates a division factor based on the ratio of followings to followers, and reduces the user's page rank by dividing it by this factor.

## 2. Pay-to-Play: The Twitter Blue Effect

It looks like Twitter Blue subscribers do get a boost in the algorithm.

Specifically, if you're a Twitter Blue subscriber, you get a 4x boost in the algorithm if you're in the same network as the author of the tweet, and a 2x boost if you're not ([source](https://dub.sh/twitter-blue-algo)).

## 3. Creating engaging content is much more important than likes/retweets

There are a few factors that determine if your tweet will appear on someone's "For You" tab.

These are calculated by a `heavy-ranker` algorithm, which receives various features describing the Tweet + the user whose timeline is being ranked for, and outputs binary predictions about how the user will engage with the Tweet.

Below are some of the probabilities that the algorithm outputs, along with their respective sentiments and weights:

| User Action                                                          | Sentiment | Weight |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | ------ |
| Like your tweet                                                      | Positive  | 0.5    |
| Retweet your tweet                                                   | Positive  | 1      |
| Click into your tweet & reply/like a tweet or stay there for >2 mins | Positive  | 11     |
| Check out your profile and like/reply to a tweet                     | Positive  | 12     |
| Reply to your tweet                                                  | Positive  | 27     |
| Reply to your tweet and you engage with this reply                   | Positive  | 75     |
| Request "show less often" on your Tweet/you, block or mute you       | Negative  | -74    |
| Report your Tweet                                                    | Negative  | -369   |

To put this in perspective:

- A user clicking on your tweet & staying there for >2 min is weighted **22x more than them just liking your tweet**.
- If they click into your profile through your tweet & likes/replies to a tweet? **24x more than a like**.
- If they reply to your tweet? **54x more than a like**.
- If they reply to your tweet _and_ you respond to their reply? **150x more than a like**.
- If they report your tweet? **-738x the effect of a like** (you're basically screwed).

## 4. Getting blocked/muted/reported is bad. Really bad.

Here are some negative feedback loops that will reduce your "reputation score" on Twitter:

- Getting blocked
- Getting muted
- Abuse reports
- Spam reports
- Unfollows (not as heavily penalized as the above 4 though)

## 5. The Government can interfere with the algorithm

When needed, the government can intervene with the Twitter algorithm.

In fact, this probably happens so often that Twitter Engineers even has a class for it - [`GovernmentRequested`](https://dub.sh/twitter-gov-intervention).

Presidential elections is also another big part of the Twitter Algorithm. During election events, the algorithm can:

- Recommend election candidates to follow ([source](https://dub.sh/twitter-gov-election))
- Suppress misinformation ([source](https://dub.sh/twitter-gov-election-msnfo))

Yup, very Big-Brother-ly.

## 6. Images & Videos are good for the algorithm

In the current light ranking model (Earlybird), tweets with images & videos seem to get a nice 2x boost ([source](https://dub.sh/earlybird-media-boost)).

However, this is an old model that Twitter is planning to rebuild completely, so things might change in the future ([source](https://dub.sh/earlybird)).

## To be continued...

This post is a work in progress - I'm still going through the codebase, so I'll update this post as I find more interesting things.
