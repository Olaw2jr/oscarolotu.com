When OpenAI announced [ChatGPT Plugins](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins) in March, it took the world by storm.

Plugins are a way to extend the functionality of ChatGPT by adding new features and capabilities. They can be used for anything from browsing the web to brainstorming a grocery list on Instacart, and more.

A few days after ChatGPT Plugins was announced, I built a free ChatGPT Plugin that helps you brainstorm domain ideas by automatically checking if they are available inside ChatGPT.

<StaticTweet id="1640378476950855680" />

Today – roughly a month later – that Plugin was [added as an official plugin](https://twitter.com/steventey/status/1653578240999424005) on the ChatGPT Plugin store, and will soon be accessible by all 1B+ users on ChatGPT.

## So...how can I build one?

Thanks to how intuitive the developer experience of building a ChatGPT Plugin is, it's actually not too complicated to build one yourself.

In essense, all you need to build a ChatGPT Plugin is:

1. Your [API backend](#1-api-backend)
2. A [Plugin manifest file](#2-plugin-manifest-file)
3. An [OpenAPI spec](#3-openapi-spec)

In this article, we'll walk through the process of building a ChatGPT Plugin using Next.js and deploying it to Vercel.

## Quickstart

Here's the repo for the plugin we'll be building in this article:

<GithubRepo url="https://github.com/steven-tey/weathergpt" />

You can also clone & deploy it to Vercel [with one click](https://vercel.com/new/clone?demo-title=WeatherGPT+%E2%80%93%C2%A0ChatGPT+Plugin+Starter&demo-description=The+ultimate+ChatGPT+Plugin+starter+template.+WeatherGPT+is+a+ChatGPT+Plugin+to+get+the+weather+of+any+given+location.&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fweathergpt.vercel.app%2F&demo-image=%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fe5382hct74si%2F7Ft2fS9gtS9XtxUNVJJENP%2F04a68855bda0524982d3c15cbd2628ac%2FCleanShot_2023-04-13_at_12.37.09.png&project-name=WeatherGPT+%E2%80%93%C2%A0ChatGPT+Plugin+Starter&repository-name=weathergpt&repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fsteven-tey%2Fweathergpt&from=templates&skippable-integrations=1&env=WEATHER_API_KEY&envDescription=Get+your+WeatherAPI+key+here%3A&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.weatherapi.com%2F&teamCreateStatus=hidden).

## About the Plugin

The ChatGPT Plugin we'll be building in this article is WeatherGPT – a plugin to get the weather of any given location.

It can also make appropriate recommendations of what outfits to wear given the weather.

E.g. "Should I wear a jacket in Boston today?"

## Tech Stack

Here's the tech stack that we'll be using to build our ChatGPT Plugin:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for the API backend
- [Edge Functions](https://vercel.com/edge) for retrieving and returning weather data
- [ImageResponse API](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/image-response) for generating dynamic OG images
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com) for hosting and deployment

## 1. API Backend

Thanks to Next.js' [Route Handlers](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/routing/route-handlers), it was fairly simple to build the API backend for WeatherGPT.

```typescript
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { geolocation } from "@vercel/edge";
import { getWeatherData } from "@/app/lib/utils";

export const runtime = "edge";

export async function GET(req: NextRequest) {
  let location = req.nextUrl.searchParams.get("location");
  if (!location) {
    const { city } = geolocation(req);
    location = city || "San Francisco";
  }

  const response = await fetch(
    `http://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json?key=${process.env.WEATHER_API_KEY}&q=${location}&aqi=no`
  ).then((res) => res.json());

  return NextResponse.json({
    ...response,
    infoLink: `https://weathergpt.vercel.app/${encodeURIComponent(location)}`,
  });
}
```

Here, we are using the [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/) to retrieve weather data for a given location.

In the case where there is no `location` parameter provided, it will use [Vercel's geolocation API](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions/vercel-edge-package#geolocation) to determine the user's location and return the accurate weather data based on that.

To try this out, go to https://weathergpt.vercel.app/api/weather to get a JSON response of the weather in your city – or https://weathergpt.vercel.app/ if you want a pretty UI.

## 2. Plugin Manifest File

Your plugin manifest file should be located in the `/.wellknown/ai-plugin.json` directory on your site.

This is similar to manifest.json for a Chrome Extension, except for 1 main difference: Your description is key – it's the prompt for your Plugin. You gotta engineer the sh\*t out of it.

This is the description for WeatherGPT:

> Use the WeatherGPT plugin to automatically fetch current weather information for a specific location when it's being generated by the ChatGPT assistant. The plugin will return weather data, including temperature, wind speed, humidity, and other relevant information, as well as a link to a page that has all the information. Links will always be returned and should be shown to the user. The weather data can be used to provide users with up-to-date and accurate weather information for their desired location.

And here's the full plugin manifest file:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "v1",
  "name_for_model": "WeatherGPT",
  "name_for_human": "WeatherGPT",
  "description_for_human": "Get current weather information for a specific location.",
  "description_for_model": "Use the WeatherGPT plugin to automatically fetch current weather information for a specific location when it's being generated by the ChatGPT assistant. The plugin will return weather data, including temperature, wind speed, humidity, and other relevant information, as well as a link to a page that has all the information. Links will always be returned and should be shown to the user. The weather data can be used to provide users with up-to-date and accurate weather information for their desired location.",
  "api": {
    "type": "openapi",
    "url": "https://weathergpt.vercel.app/openapi.json",
    "has_user_authentication": false
  },
  "auth": {
    "type": "none"
  },
  "logo_url": "https://weathergpt.vercel.app/logo.png",
  "contact_email": "stey@vercel.com",
  "legal_info_url": "https://weathergpt.vercel.app/legal"
}
```

## 3. OpenAPI Spec

This is a standard OpenAPI spec, with a stronger emphasis on the "description" fields for all endpoints. It's location should match the `api.url` field in your plugin manifest file (e.g. `/openapi.json`).

Here's the OpenAPI spec for WeatherGPT: https://github.com/steven-tey/weathergpt/blob/main/public/openapi.json

## Dynamic OG image cards

To make the plugin more visually appealing, we can use Next.js' [ImageResponse API](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/image-response) to generate dynamic OG image cards for each weather location, which will be returned as a nice card link inside ChatGPT (as seen [above](#about-the-plugin)).

Here's the [code](https://github.com/steven-tey/weathergpt/blob/main/app/%5Blocation%5D/opengraph-image.tsx) I'm using for the dynamic OG images in WeatherGPT.

<StaticTweet id="1646936335465447425" />

You can also refer to [Vercel OG image generation docs](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions/og-image-generation) for more information.

## Securing Your API Endpoints

To prevent unauthorized access to your API endpoints, you can whitelist OpenAI's IP CIDR blocks.

Here's a simple code snippet you can use to veirfy that the request is coming from OpenAI:

```typescript
function ipToInt(ip: string) {
  return ip.split(".").reduce((acc, octet) => (acc << 8) + parseInt(octet), 0);
}

function isIpInCIDR(ip: string, cidr: string) {
  const [cidrIp, prefixLength] = cidr.split("/");
  const mask = -1 << (32 - parseInt(prefixLength));
  const ipInt = ipToInt(ip);
  const cidrIpInt = ipToInt(cidrIp);

  const networkAddress = cidrIpInt & mask;
  const broadcastAddress = networkAddress | ~mask;

  return ipInt >= networkAddress && ipInt <= broadcastAddress;
}

export default function validChatGPTIp(ip: string) {
  // verify both CIDR blocks from the docs: https://platform.openai.com/docs/plugins/production/ip-egress-ranges
  return (
    isIpInCIDR(ip, "23.102.140.112/28") || isIpInCIDR(ip, "23.98.142.176/28")
  );
}
```

## Testing Your Plugin & Deploying it to Production

Before deploying your plugin to production, you can test it using the following tools:

- [Ngrok tunnel](https://ngrok.com/) to your localhost instance
- [Vercel Preview URLs](https://vercel.com/features/previews)

Once you're satisfied with your plugin's functionality, add it to ChatGPT with the following steps:

1. Go to the plugin store.
2. Click on "Develop your own plugin".
3. Enter your plugin's domain.
4. Click on "Find Manifest File" > "Next" > "Install for me".

## Conclusion

The developer experience for building a ChatGPT Plugin is sublime.

I went into it expecting to write code logic to tell ChatGPT what to do. I ended up writing mostly natural language and everything _just worked_.

It really takes declarative programming to the next level. The closest analogy I can think of:

- JavaScript/jQuery → React/Next.js
- Chrome Extension development → ChatGPT Plugin development

Instead of writing imperative JS code, you _describe_ what you want ChatGPT to do. The rest is history.
